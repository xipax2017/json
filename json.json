  "description": "The best Game Boy Advanced Emulator for iOS, you can download all the game ROMs you need form within the app! Have Fun. - MONGOLO\r\n\r\nofficial website - http:\/\/gba4iosapp.com\/\r\n\r\nGame Boy Advance, meet iOS.\r\nAgain.\r\n\r\n\r\nOut with the Old, In with the New.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you\\'ll notice about the app is how completely different it looks. GBA4iOS 2.0 was designed from the ground up for iOS 7, with the goal of making everything not only look better, but simpler to use. Taking this a step further, GBA4iOS now has a built-in web browser for downloading games, making it much easier to start playing your favorite Game Boy Advance games. Finally, 2.0 has been fully optimized for iPads, giving Apple\\'s tablet a first class emulation experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith GBA4iOS, cheaters always win.\r\n\r\nThe number one most requested feature is finally here: GBA4iOS 2.0 has full support for cheats! Playing some classic games are nice, but cheats give you a whole new level of freedom with what you can do. With support for five different cheat code formats, you don\\'t have to worry about whether your code is compatible with GBA4iOS - it just works. Better still, per-game Master Codes are handled for you automatically by GBA4iOS, making the cheating experience just that much easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake Classic Gaming one step further.\r\n\r\nThe Game Boy Advance revolutionized the handheld gaming industry. For the first time, it was possible to have a video game console with the power of a Super Nintendo in your pocket. However, before the Game Boy Advance was ever released, Nintendo had launched two extraordinarily successful devices into the portable game console market: the Game Boy and the Game Boy Color. An amazing feature of the Game Boy Advance was its backwards-compatibility with these previous portable console games, and now GBA4iOS is doing the same. No longer do you have to find a separate emulator to play these old games; if it\\'s a Game Boy anything game, GBA4iOS has you covered.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomizability is Key.\r\n\r\nGBA4iOS 2.0 comes with a set of beautiful controller skins for both Game Boy Advance and Game Boy (Color) games. However, with thousands of games available to play, we wanted to give users just as many options for the skins they use to play the games with. Unlike previous versions of GBA4iOS, 2.0 has the ability to use an unlimited number of 3rd party controller skins. Want to have a Mario skin when you rescue the princess, or a Pokemon skin while you catch them all? With customizable controller skins, the possibilities are endless. To make the process easier, you can download the controller skins in-app, or alternatively download them from a 3rd party skin site such as GBA4iOSkins.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd with so many other features, GBA4iOS 2.0 is much more than an update.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s a completely new experience.",
